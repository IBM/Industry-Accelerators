AUTO|F|2017-07-19 08:53:37|cnbc.com|https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/19/jpmorgan-asset-management-us-dollar-will-rebound-in-second-half-of-2017.html|The US dollar will rebound in the second half of 2017, says JPMorgan|The current weakness in the U.S. dollar may be short lived, as a pick-up in inflation and expected rate hikes by the Federal Reserve will support the greenback in the coming months, JPMorgan Asset Management said Wednesday. "We're thinking that the dollar will actually rebound in the second half, and this is mainly as the markets re-price in interest rates hike. We're of the view that inflation will actually be picking up in the U.S. and currently, markets have only priced in one rate hike now till end-2018," Jasslyn Yeo, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNBC's "Street Signs." "So, we think (markets) are going to do a bit of re-pricing and that will support a bit of a rebound in the dollar," she added. The U.S. dollar tumbled to a 10-month low on Tuesday after the Republican health-care bill aimed at replacing Obamacare failed to get enough backing to proceed to a debate. Some market observers have said that a weaker dollar can help to boost earnings of S&P 500 companies and eventually justify their high valuations. But Yeo said equity markets outside the U.S., such as Europe and Japan, have more upside potential. Yeo noted that margins in Europe are starting to improve and that could translate into stronger earnings growth, while Japan is likely to benefit from a weaker yen versus the U.S. dollar. "We still like certain spots in the U.S. market. Currently we still favor U.S. banks, which we like in terms of rate hike expectations, bond yields moving higher as well as the promise for financial deregulation in the banking system," she said. "Purely from a valuation play we think that U.S. valuations are more challenging at the moment and investors should be looking to diversify out of the U.S. to other various markets."

Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Harley-Davidson Inc (Symbol: HOG) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Harley-Davidson Inc, looking at the history chart for HOG below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, HOG makes up 2.46% of the First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund ETF (Symbol: CARZ) which is trading lower by about 0.6% on the day Tuesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.This article appears in: Investing , Options

BIDU announced a new partnership to help drive the autonomous vehicle revolution forward on Tuesday.Baidu, the ever-growing Chinese internet company, started a corporative alliance of companies to help grow and advance self-driving car technology called Apollo - named after the Apollo Moon landing program.Microsoft was one of roughly 50 companies, along with Bosch BOCH and Continental, working with Baidu as part of this large-scale alliance determined to help kick start the next vehicle and travel evolution.Now, the two companies' more comprehensive partnership will see Microsoft's Azure cloud platform help supply global scale and reach for Baidu's Apollo corporative outside of China.Baidu's COO Qi Lu previously referred to the Apollo self-driving alliance as the "Android of the autonomous driving industry."Baidu announced the Apollo open platform concept to help create a massive, overarching, safe, and, dependable group dedicated to effectively bringing self-driving vehicle technology to the world."Our goal with Apollo is to provide an open and powerful platform to the automotive industry to further the goal of autonomous vehicles," Ya-Qin Zhang, president of Baidu said in a statement."By using Azure, our partners outside of China will have access to a trustworthy and secure public cloud, enabling them to focus on innovating instead of building their own cloud-based infrastructure."Automotive companies such as BMW, Ford F , and Toyota TM currently work with Microsoft to utilize its cloud tech in order to help with predictive maintenance, voice-controls, and driver assistance features. Microsoft's cloud platforms offer these car companies the ability to store massive amounts of vehicle data, analyze the information, and turn it into actionable results."We're excited to partner with Baidu to take a giant step in helping automotive manufacturers and suppliers fully realize the promise of autonomous driving," Microsoft corporate vice president, Kevin Dallas said the same statement."By applying our global cloud AI, machine learning, and deep neural network capabilities to that data, we can accelerate the work already being done to make autonomous vehicles safer."Baidu's Microsoft partnership comes just a few weeks after the company made a deal with NVIDIA NVDA . The chipmaker is set to provide its powerful GPUs to help enhance Baidu's AI in an effort to improve its cloud computing services, self-driving vehicle technology, and home assistance ventures.Shares of Baidu were up 0.88% through morning trading, while Microsoft fell roughly 0.75%.More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

AUTO|F|2017-07-16 07:38:20|http://www.nasdaq.com|http://www.nasdaq.com/article/what-investors-missed-in-the-market-this-week-cm816567|What Investors Missed in the Market This Week|There was quite a bit going on in the markets this week, with retail in the spotlight -- though not for a good reason. According to the government, sales at retailers nationwide dropped 0.2% in June, which was the second consecutive decline and equal to the largest drop this year. That performance suggests the U.S. economy hasn't jumped as strongly as anticipated after a meager first quarter. We'll wait to see if that news has any implications for the Federal Reserve's interest-rate plans, but for now here are some other major retailing stories from the week.Amazon can do anything you can doBest Buy Co. Inc. (NYSE: BBY)  saw its shares take a hard fall Monday, after news hit that Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) is launching a new service that drew comparisons to Best Buy's Geek Squad and its "Best Buy Smart Home powered by Vivint" service.Amazon's " Smart Home " service is only in seven major markets so far -- Seattle; Portland, Ore.; and five California locations: San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Jose. This is Amazon's attempt to connect the dots between its products such as Alexa and smart-home solutions that include anything from thermostats to home security systems, and nearly anything in between -- even light bulbs.Image source: Getty Images.Another angle for investors to consider in light of this news could include the acquisition of Control4 (NASDAQ: CTRL)  or a similar company. This is complete speculation on my part, but if Amazon gets serious about doing more in the smart-home service area, Control4 offers a premium smart-home solution, with costs ranging from $1,000 all the way up to $50,000 and a target consumer with annual household incomes higher than $150,000. Control4 already has a sizable footprint in 91 countries and a network of roughly 5,000 retailers and distributors. This wouldn't be a move Amazon would make anytime soon, as it already has its hands full with recent acquisitions, but it's certainly an intriguing company for investors to watch as this scenario plays out.Struggle zoneAbercrombie & Fitch (NYSE: ANF) has a widely recognizable brand, but that can't stop the retailer from suffering right along with many other clothing retailers that have a major presence in malls around America. Mall traffic is in decline, with e-commerce stealing more transactions every day. And this week didn't bring any better news for the retailer, as its stock shed roughly 25% of its value after a potential sale of the company never materialized."After a comprehensive review of all relevant factors, with the assistance of our financial advisor, the A&F Board of Directors determined that the best path to enhance value for stockholders is the rigorous execution of our business plan," said Arthur Martinez, executive chairman of the board, in a press release.With the stock shedding about one-fourth of its value this week, investors are selling the idea that a companywide turnaround is in the making anytime soon. The recent trends speak for themselves, with the namesake Abercrombie brand seeing its comparable sales falling 10% during the last quarter. That was only slightly offset by a 3% increase from its Hollister brand, with an overall decline of 3% when all brands are taken into account.With malls dying a slow death and a lacking e-commerce story from Abercrombie, it's not all that surprising that none of its partners discussing a sale pulled the trigger. It's time for investors to look elsewhere for a value stock.10 stocks we like better than Control4 When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Control4 wasn't one of them!

AUTO|F|2016-11-13 08:53:37|nasdaq.com|http://www.nasdaq.com/article/why-auto-investors-are-worried-about-the-united-states-cm708299|Why Auto Investors Are Worried About the United States|Shares of the Detroit automakers have had a tough ride in 2016. Year to date, Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) shares are down almost 13%, while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles '(NYSE: FCAU) are down nearly 17%.General Motors '(NYSE: GM) shares are about flat for the year, but only because a sharp rally on Thursday and Friday erased its losses. Through this past Wednesday, GM's stock was down about 9% since the beginning of 2016.It doesn't seem fair. All three have reported strong profits in recent quarters. But investors have been worried about the U.S. new-car market, which accounts for the bulk of Detroit's profits -- and which is showing signs of slowing down.Strong truck and SUV sales have generated fat profits for Detroit over the last few years. Image source: Ford Motor Company.North America is extremely important to Detroit's bottom linesGM, Ford, and FCA are all global companies with huge operations around the world. But all three, more so than most of their global rivals, are still very dependent on profits in North America, most of which come from the United States.Data sources: the automakers' earnings reports. Chart shows adjusted pre-tax profits in North America (blue) as a percentage of overall pre-tax profits (blue plus green) for 2016 through Sept. 30. FCA's results have been converted from euros to U.S. dollars at a rate of 1 euro = $1.09.That makes the state of the U.S. new-car market very important to investors in the Detroit automakers. And as I said, there are growing signs that it may be past its cyclical peak.As U.S. sales go, so do Detroit's profitsAuto sales are cyclical. Demand for new cars and trucks is closely correlated with consumer confidence, for reasons that are probably obvious: People and businesses hold off on buying new vehicles when they're concerned that their earnings are going to be squeezed.The pace of auto sales is tracked using a calculated statistic called the "SAAR," for "seasonally adjusted annualized rate." If we say that the SAAR for October 2016 was 17.65 million, it means that if the pace of auto sales we saw in October were maintained for a full calendar year, 17.65 million vehicles would be sold that year.There are several different calculations of SAAR. The most important one for our purposes is the one that shows the pace of U.S. sales of "light vehicles," meaning cars, pickups, and SUVs. This chart shows the SAAR for the past three years.The pace of sales can vary considerably from month to month, but the trend isn't too hard to see: While it's still very strong by historical standards, the pace of light-vehicle sales in the U.S. peaked late in 2015 and has fallen off since.This longer-term chart, showing mostly SAAR figures all the way back to the beginning of 2000, might make the picture more clear.U.S. light-vehicle sales plateaued from 2000 through 2006, fell off a cliff in 2008, and didn't really recover to pre-recession levels until 2014. They went a little higher in 2015 and have slipped back a bit in 2016.What does it mean if the auto sales cycle is past its peak?As last decade's data shows, if the economy is reasonably strong, auto sales can stay at a plateau for several years. That might be how things play out this time. But there are signs that automakers are starting to scrounge for sales growth by boosting their incentives. That's not an encouraging sign for investors, as rising incentives tend to eat into profit margins.There are other signs. Just in the past few weeks, both Ford and GM have announced production cuts . They were modest ones, but production cuts of any kind aren't something we'd expect to see in a growing market.For long-term investors, there's no reason to panic: A cyclical sales decline is normal and inevitable. But it's worth keeping in mind that as sales in North America taper off, profits at the Detroit automakers are likely to come under pressure for a while.Forget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than Ford Donald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up.

AUTO|F|2016-11-12 05:37:27|nasdaq.com|http://www.nasdaq.com/article/donald-trump-and-the-stock-market-did-you-miss-these-moves-cm708221|Donald Trump and the Stock Market: Did You Miss These Moves?|I've decided that the markets are similar to small children: Just when you believe you have them figured out, they zig when you anticipate a zag. Donald Trump shocked the nation with his surprise victory earlier this week, and Dow futures abruptly dropped roughly 850 points -- more than the drop after the events of 9/11. Then, something crazy happened. That decline abruptly reversed in the morning hours, and throughout the week, enabling the Dow to post its largest weekly gain since 2011. Raise your hand if you saw that coming? Go ahead; I'll wait.While there's a huge amount of uncertainty attached to Trump's upcoming presidency, we should all remember to avoid knee-jerk reactions, because you just never know when the market will zig instead of zag. Sticking with the Trump theme, here are some companies making big headlines or big moves this week.Fiat Chrysler's Trump cardThe auto industry can't catch a break this year, with Brexit throwing a curveball in Europe and sales peaking in the U.S. market. Now, Trump has mentioned a couple of strings he might yank that could complicate things for multiple major automakers.Trump mentioned potentially adding tariffs to vehicles exported from Mexico to the U.S., which would make it more expensive for Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and General Motors to produce small cars in Mexico and bring them to the states. Some estimate (take it with a grain of salt) that the additional cost could reach $5,000 per vehicle. Despite that negative prediction, automakers largely rebounded this week for one reason: likely relaxed emissions standards. And that left Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA) in the dust, watching other automakers surge higher.TSLA Price data by YCharts .The story is simple: Trump plans to complete a comprehensive review of all federal regulations, especially the fuel economy and emissions standards. The belief is that the emissions standards, set to require fleets to average 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, will be relaxed significantly.Tesla's Model S. Image source: Tesla Motors.That would hinder demand for electric vehicles, which Tesla solely focuses on, and enable Detroit automakers to focus more on larger vehicles. "We cannot see this in a positive light for Tesla," said Morgan Stanley 's Adam Jonas, speaking in regards to the election results, according to Barron's . "An environment that moves away from incentivizing electric vehicles is clearly adverse to the story."That's also why Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE: FCAU) jumped the highest this week. It benefited the most since it was drastically behind the industry in terms of developing electric vehicles or hybrids and still heavily relies on Jeep and Ram Truck for profits.Defense and industrials stocks surgeI'll refrain from quoting any of Trump's speeches, but it's pretty clear if you heard him over the course of his campaign that defense companies are poised to benefit -- and that was certainly reflected in the markets this week.RTN Price data by YCharts .Morningstar even took a broad brush to its price targets for defense companies: "Our new fair value estimates are as follows: General Dynamics $168 (from $155), Raytheon $151 ($144), L-3 Communications $145 ($138), Northrop Grumman $208 ($192), Lockheed Martin $224 ($221), and Boeing $151 ($145)."Image source: Getty Images.Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) had an even better week as it secured a contract from the U.S. Air Force to provide vehicles and support equipment for Lot 10 Miniature Air Launched Decoy Jammer, or MALD-J. The contract is valued at just over $76 million.In terms of industrials, Trump's victory was a huge boon for U.S. Concrete (NASDAQ: USCR) ; its stock price jumped 17% for the week. It's not difficult to understand why, either. U.S. Concrete generates almost 60% of its revenues from selling products in the commercial and industrial construction business, and another 16% from street, highway, and other public projects.Both of those segments stand to benefit from Trump's promised infrastructure spending, especially the latter. Beyond that, it's even more encouraging for investors of U.S. Concrete because the company operates most of its business in critical markets such as New York; New Jersey; Washington, D.C.; Northern California; and Texas.Even better yet, the company's business revolves around selling ready-mix concrete and aggregates to construction companies, so it's a less risky play since the company doesn't have to win contracts to benefit from massive infrastructure spending.Ultimately, these are just a couple of the sectors that were impacted significantly this week thanks to Trump's surprise victory. But we all need to remember that he doesn't take office until January, and we don't know for sure how quickly his policy changes will happen or how broad they will be.Forget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than US Concrete Donald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up.

And as is typical, stocks rallied once this cloud of uncertainty was lifted. Even better, we as investors can start looking past the government to the real drivers of the economy and stock market profits.On that front you have an improving economy (+2.9% Q3 GDP Growth) + low rate environment = extension of bull market.However we are now winding around to the 8th year anniversary for this bull market. That's the second longest in history. Unfortunately it also means that the easy money has already been made and valuations are near fully engorged.When you add it all up it says the bull market is still on. Just that the pace of gains is slowing down to around 5% per year...10% if you are lucky.To be clear, these modest gains are the likely outcome if you stick with most mutual funds or index investing. Gladly there are proven strategies that can help you select better stocks and handily beat the market.Below I share with you the 4 essential ingredients for selecting the best stocks at this time. I truly believe that following these strategies can lead to doubling, even tripling, the average market return. Ingredient #1: growth, Growth, GROWTH!Defensive investments outperformed for all of 2015 and the first half of 2016. That boring investment party is now over. No longer should you focus on the safest of safe stocks. The way to outperformance is by finding companies that are experiencing exceptional growth.On the surface it sounds like I am just saying to buy those companies experiencing the highest % year over year growth. However, quite often those are risky stocks that are severely overpriced.Instead I am saying to buy sound companies experiencing above trend earnings growth that will drive EPS and share price appreciation in the future. When trend = only 3-5% earnings growth, then even 10% annual EPS gains is impressive.On top of that seek companies where earnings estimates are on the rise...which as you know is the foundation of the Zacks Rank and its 26% average annual return. That's because these are the companies with the best growth prospects, which is a beacon signaling other investors towards the shares. So focus on Zacks Rank #1 and #2 buy rated stocks.More . . .------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sunday Deadline: See All Zacks Buys & Sells FreeYes, it's true and no other investment research firm offers this arrangement:Starting now, for the next 7 days, you may see all real-time picks from all Zacks' private portfolios absolutely free.

The Flight to Safety movement the past two years also meant outperformance for large cap stocks.Now those ultra-conservative names are played out and small caps and mid caps are starting to win the day. This trend should continue given all the ground they need to make up from the past couple years of underperformance.Yes, these smaller stocks are generally riskier. That is why you should consider having more stocks in your portfolio, each with a smaller allocation. This form of diversification also helps mitigate risk so you can enjoy greater rewards. Ingredient #3: Avoid Interest Rate Sensitive StocksAfter hitting historic lows...interest rates are finally back on the rise and likely to stay on the rise given statements by the Fed. This will hurt all stock groups that benefited from low rates. Namely income stocks whose ONLY appeal is their high dividends (Ex. Utilities, REITs, MLPs etc).This problem will also extend to growth and income stocks in stable/defensive industries. Too much of their past appeal came from above average dividends and not enough from real earnings growth. These stocks will lag as rates go higher.What is not as obvious to investors is how this effects industries that rely on low rates to sell more of their product. Automobiles and home construction are ones that come to mind. The higher rates go...the higher the financing costs...the more expensive their products become...the less they will likely sell. That is not a serious problem for their business models at this stage, but as the trend continues it will be an impediment that harms profits and share prices. Ingredient #4: ValueIt never hurts to buy stocks at a discount to their peers. The problem is that most investors have a set of historical standards for what they believe equates to a value stock. I am referring to certain measures of PE or Book Value or PEG etc. that typically denote an undervalued security.Unfortunately, 7.5 years into a bull market you will discover that most every stock is above those levels. Thus, those looking for absolute value based on these historical measures will find no stocks in their basket. So the key is to use relative value measures to squeeze out additional gains. That is where the Zacks Value Score comes into play.For example, our "A" rated value stocks are in the top 20% in terms of the value criteria that have been proven to lead to outperformance. Combine that with "B" rated stocks and you will be focused on the top 40% of value stocks available. These stocks should make up the bulk of your portfolio. And yes, do strongly consider selling those with D or F ratings for this important criteria as they will prove to be a drag on your portfolio. Where to Find the Trades that Are Best for YouThe above ingredients will get you on the right track. However, in a world with over 10,000 stocks to choose from, far too many will seem to fit the bill.That may be fine if you are a professional investor with 60-80 hours per week to focus on researching the full list. For the rest of you, it's usually better to start by looking at recommendations from professionals with strategies and a track record you can trust.That's why back in 2011, I started a program to provide access to all of our buys and sells, even to portfolios that are normally closed to new investors.

AUTO|F|2016-11-12 05:26:05|http://www.nasdaq.com|http://www.nasdaq.com/article/ford-motor-company-f-stock-is-a-great-buy-for-income-investors-cm708110|Ford Motor Company (F) Stock Is a Great Buy for Income Investors|Dicey Third Quarter Results for FFord's third-quarter results were not necessarily good news for investors, but the company didn't dole out a massive disappointment either.Traders were expecting to see F stock stumble this quarter because the company had to pony up some $600 million to replace door latches in a massive 2.4 million vehicle recall.The firm also updated its Kentucky plant in order to launch its new Super Duty pickup truck - so to say there were quite a few large expenses this quarter is an understatement.The numbers certainly weren't pretty, Ford's net income fell 56% percent from the same quarter in 2015 and investors were understandably spooked.The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2017However with that being said, the numbers don't necessarily spell complete disaster for F and the worries weighing on the firm's shares make Ford stock a relatively cheap income play.And the good news is that much of what brought Ford's North American sales lower is unlikely to have a major impact on the fourth quarter, so F stock is likely to see a lift when those results come out.The recall isn't expected to impact Ford at all in the fourth quarter and the issues with the Super Duty rollout won't be nearly as expensive as they were in the third.What About Demand for Ford Stock?It's true that the U.S. auto sector is headed for a low in the coming years as demand wanes. However, that doesn't mean that all automakers are going to tank - people will still buy vehicles, it's just a question of how well automakers are able to protect their margins when demand is low.Ford is planning to slow its production in order to cope with a more difficult sales environment.Many investors have turned away from the auto industry after the disaster that was 2008, but it's important to consider that automakers are much better equipped to deal with a cyclical downturn than they were eight years ago.Ford is also making progress abroad in both Europe and Asia. In Europe, Ford raked in $138 million worth of pre-tax profit and the firm maintained its stronghold on the market as Europe's best-selling commercial vehicle brand. In Asia-Pacific, sales topped 1 million units and the company made inroads to India's car-sharing economy by investing in Zoomcar .These figures are solid reminders that Ford isn't just its North American sales and investors should consider the firm's successes in other countries as well.What About That Juicy Dividend?Perhaps the most enticing thing about Ford stock is the company's impressive 5.2% dividend yield. There is some question as to whether or not Ford will be able to continue paying such a high dividend, but the company's financials show that F has enough free cash flow to ease investors' minds. In 2015 the firm generated $8.9 billion from its operations, and has a dividend payout ratio of 42% which is fairly consistent with the company's peers.General Electric Company (GE) Stock Is an Overpriced JuggernautFord is a cheap income buy right now, due in large part to investors' fears that the auto industry will see a repeat of the 2008 carnage. While markets are certainly facing some uncertainty at the moment and the auto industry is likely to experience a cyclical downturn in the future, Ford is strong enough to withstand a shaky period.A stock with a price-to-earnings ratio of 5.64% and a dividend yield of 5.3% doesn't come around often- so income investors should jump at the chance.As of this writing, Laura Hoy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlaceThe post Ford Motor Company (F) Stock Is a Great Buy for Income Investors appeared first on InvestorPlace .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.Referenced Symbols: F , GE
