## Introduction
Customer 360 Degree View accelerator includes a structured glossary of more than 100 business terms and set of sample data science artefacts. The glossary provides the information architecture that you need to understand your customers better. Jump-start your analysis to get a complete picture of your customer base. Your data scientists can use the data associated with this glossary to gain insight into facets such as:
- Customer segmentation
- Credit risk
- Loyalty
- Social media sentiment
When you import the accelerator on Watson Knowledge Catalog, the terms are added to your business glossary under the Customer 360 Degree View category.
This is a glossary only accelerator.


## Business glossary for use with Watson Knowledge Catalog
You can import the glossary of business terms into Watson Knowledge Catalog to get started on data governance using the below files available in the project tar file. <br>
The `customer-360-degree-view-glossary-categories.csv` file defines the main and sub categories for the business terms. <br>
The `customer-360-degree-view-glossary-terms.csv` file defines the business terms, category of the business terms and their Related Terms/Part of Terms, if applicable. <br>
