The glossary provides the information architecture that you need to analyse how far people would travel for medical care in Texas, USA. Data scientists can use the sample notebook and dashboard to accelerate data preparation and data visualization and analysis. The accelerator comes packaged with synthetic data. The notebook also includes code that allows the user to download and use real data. Example sources for the real data are listed below.
