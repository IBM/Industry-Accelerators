The glossary provides the information architecture that you need to analyse how far people would travel for medical care in Texas, USA. Data scientists can use the sample notebook and dashboard to accelerate data preparation and data visualization and analysis. The accelerator comes packaged with synthetic data. The notebook also includes code that allows the user to download and use real data. Example sources for the real data are listed below.

You can replace this with your own data or other data from an external source, some examples are provided below.\nThe synthetic data was generated using Synthea - a Synthetic Patient Population Simulator developed by the Mitre Corporation, available at https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea\n\n1: Patients geographical information with latitude, longitude and zip <br>\n   - Synthetic Data Source: synthetic patients zip location data.csv\n   - Real Data Source: http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/2016_Gazetteer/2016_Gaz_zcta_national.zip <br>\n\n2: Diagnosis data in different quarters of the year. <br>\n   - Synthetic Data Source: synthetic diagnosis data.csv\n   - Real Data Source: https://www.dshs.texas.gov. License Agreement: https://www.dshs.texas.gov/THCIC/Hospitals/Download.shtm <br>\n\n3: Hospital names with longitude and latitude  <br>\n   - Synthetic Data Source: synthetic hospital details.csv\n   - Real Data Source: https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/xubh-q36u/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD&sorting=true \n\n\nThe idea is to generate a dataset which combines above 3 datasets. The final dataset will contain details on the following.\n1. Patients health information including age, illness severity, zip code etc.\n2. Information about the hospital, such as hospital id, name, coordinates of the hospital etc.\n3. Nearest hospital to patient, admitted hospital and the distance travelled to reach the hospital, charges per day.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Notebooks\n\n* **Data-Preparation:** It includes steps to download the data sets or alternatively use the synthetic data, clean them and carry out sequence of joins to return the final data set with above information.\n* **App-deployment:** It includes steps to create a deployment space, Store and deploy R Shiny app; generate url to view the app.\n* Optional - **0-Map_Business_Terms_to_data_headers** : This notebook publishes the project csv files into a specified catalog. It reads mappings from the csv files and applies business terms to the published dataset headers.\n\n### R Shiny Dashboard\n\n* **Dashboard View** : Shows top hospitals which patients visited for the particular diagnosis and their competitors along with some diagnosis information such as age of patients.\n* **Hospital View** : Targets individual hospitals, maps to indicate the distance travelled by the patients, type of the insurance patients use in different hospitals.\n\n\nThe dashboard app is deployed in App-deployment notebook and includes instructions on how to access the dashboard app.\n\nAlternatively, user can run the dashboard from R-Studio console using below steps\n\n* Download the **healthcare_services_location_optimization-dashboard** zip file from project data_assets .\n* From the project homepage Launch the IDE for R-Studio.\n* Upload the **healthcare_services_location_optimization-dashboard** zip file in to rstudio.\n* Navigate to **app.R** file and click on Run App option to launch the dashboard.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "\n### Sequence of steps to run -- \n\n* Open Data-Preparation & execute step-by-step\n* Open App-deployment notebook & execute step-by-step.\n* Open the dashboard from the url generated in App-deployment notebook.<br>\n    Alternatively, open the dashboard using R-Studio IDE."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "**Sample Materials, provided under license. <br>\nLicensed Materials - Property of IBM. <br>\n\u00a9 Copyright IBM Corp. 2019, 2020.
