# Sample Streamlit app for QnA with RAG

This is Sample Streamlit app provides a UI interface for the `Q&A with RAG accelerator`. It allows a user to ask questions about a given corpus of documents which are answered using a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. Along with the answer, the app references the source documents used to generate the answer. In addition, the user can provide feedback in a configurable range along with a free text comment. There is also an option to recommend a subject matter expert if the user is not satisfied with the answer.

This app requires an external API which is provided by the `Q&A with RAG accelerator` project template deployed on `Watsonx.ai` `SaaS` or `On Prem`.
For the IBM Cloud SaaS version, please refer to the [IBM Resource Hub](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/exchange/public/entry/view/75b22cbe-8a20-44a5-ac65-3a927e92cb0e?context=wx). For the CPD On Prem version, access to the `Q&A with RAG accelerator` can be requested through your IBM client team. The `Q&A with RAG accelerator` must be configured and deployed according to the needs of your use case.

## Features
- UI interface that sends user queries to the API and displays the response based on Q&A RAG deployment on watsonx.ai.
- Feedback rating options to select.
- Toggle button to display or hide the source documents.
- Feedback buttons (based on rating options selected) for each response. By default - we have added support from min 2 to 5 max feedback ratings in this app.
- Expert Recommendations are available for each user question based on user rating below 100%. (Optional)

## Requirements
- `Python3` for local setup both py3.9 and py3.11 versions works.
- `Docker` or `Podman` container engine to build your local container image.[Optional]
- `Q&A RAG Accelerator` project setup on `Watsonx.ai` `aaS` or `On Prem` must be deployed.

## Pre - Reqs to run this app
- Please make sure to run Q&A RAG pipeline and copy deployment function url from the deployment space where it is deployed on Watsonx.ai aaS or On Prem environments. 
- Admin user should update the .env file in this folder. Must gather details of watsonx.ai endpoint configuration details before starting this.
- Clone or download this repository.
- Navigate to the project directory `QnA_chatbot_app`
- Please make sure to update the `.env` hidden file according to your specific use case.

   - To configure the endpoint of the Q&A RAG Accelerator for connection with the Streamlit app: [Required]
   
     - `QNA_RAG_DEPLOYMENT_URL` should be set to the public endpoint URL of the QnA RAG function, either on watsonx.ai SaaS or on-prem.
     - To obtain this URL, navigate to the `Deployments` tab. Select the deployment space used in your watsonx.ai project, then click on the Deployments tab to view the online deployments. Look for one named `rag_scoring_function_with_elasticsearch` or `rag_scoring_function_with_milvus`. If these are not available, please run the Q&A RAG pipeline to deploy it quickly.
     - Once deployed, check the deployment details and choose the one with the matching `serving name` based on the `deployment serving name` parameter provided in your watsonx.ai **Q&A with RAG Accelerator** project. Then select the deployment under `API reference` & copy the `Public endpoint` url. For eg:
     - For 1.x RAG deployments
       - For SaaS deployments see [link here](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/ml-runtime/deployments), and the endpoint URL will be in the following format:

### Deploy on IBM Cloud CE from your local source code.

- Admin user can use IBM Cloud Repository and IBM Cloud code engine to deploy their app which is by following below steps from their local source code.
- In this procedure, private IBM cloud repository will be used by Code Engine to build your image and use for deployment automatically via background process in a secure way & this has less pre-reqs to deploy your app.

#### Steps to deploy on Cloud
- Make sure you have required details below to deploy

1. Logon to IBM Cloud via apikey:
   ```
   ibmcloud login --apikey <your_iam_apikey_based_your_ibmcloudaccount> -r <your region, e.g. eu-de>
   ```
   **Note** for each IBMaccount you have different api key. please make sure to use right account and its apikey which has enough permissions to access IBM Code Engine and IBM Container Repository to deploy this app.
2. Install IBM code engine plugin if not done already
   `ibmcloud plugin install code-engine`
3. Make sure to setup target region, account, resourcegroup on your ibmcloud client. Make sure you select resource group which has enough permissions to access IBM Code Engine and IBM Container Repository to deploy this app.
   `ibmcloud target -g <resourcegroup>`
4. Create project on your code engine account if you don't have existing one -  https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-manage-project
   `ibmcloud ce project create -n <name_your_project_on_ce>`
    **Note** Make sure you have enough quota to create a project with your IBM cloud account. 
6. Select the project where you want to deploy
   `ibmcloud ce project select -n <name_your_project_on_ce>`
7. Make sure you are in `QnA_chatbot_app` folder location. 
8. Then Create and Deploy your streamlit application on Code Engine & wait for it to complete.
   - `ibmcloud ce app create --name <name_your_streamlitapp> --build-source .` <br> **Note** You might face issues with quota limits or IAM configurations with your IBM cloud account. Please check troubleshoot steps before running above cmd.
   <br> The . indicates the build source is located in your current working directory or specify the path where `QnA_chatbot_app` folder exists.
9. Get your public deployment on Code Engine by listing your app name when it is Ready.
   `ibmcloud ce app list | grep <name_of_your_streamlitapp>`
10. Copy the URL and paste on your browser to connect your streamlit app. it may take few secs to bring the app up.
11. To check logs of the application, please run below.
   `ibmcloud ce app logs --name <name_of_your_streamlitapp>`


### How to deploy on Prem RedHat OCP

This procedure requries On Prem Cluster based on RedHat Openshift, OpenShift CLI and Container Engine(Optional)

#### Pre-reqs
- Install OC cli follow steps from official documentation https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.13/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#cli-installing-cli_cli-developer-commands
- Install Container Registry like Podman/Docker & also make use existing Openshift Container Engine is exposed on Cluster to use.
- RH Cluster details and its Kubeadmin level creds to access.
- Any Linux node with minimum configuration or infra node of cluster

#### Steps to deploy on Prem (Required advanced admin previlages)

1. Log on to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster using the OpenShift Cli from any linux node or infra node.
  - Please provide required creds for login to the OC cluster and run below cmd. Need kubeadmin privilages.
  `oc login <openshift-console-url> --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true -u <kubeadmin-username> -p <kubeadmin-password>`

2. create in-cluster image registry default route
   ```
   oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster --type merge -p '{"spec"{"defaultRoute":true}} -n openshift-image-registry'
   ```
   - once enabled. you should see details default route for container engine exposed.
   for example below, Host/port:
   ```
   oc get routes -n openshift-image-registry
   NAME            HOST/PORT                                                            PATH   SERVICES         PORT    TERMINATION   WILDCARD
   default-route   default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.<example.cp.fyre.ibm>.com          image-registry   <all>   reencrypt     None
   ```
   - check if default route is exposed by running below cmd which should same as route host as above for example.
   `oc registry info -n openshift-image-registry`
3. Login to container registry using the installed local container engine 
   `<contianer-engine> login -u <kubeadmin-username> -p $(oc whoami -t) $(oc registry info -n openshift-image-registry) --tls-verify=false`
4. Navigate to location of QnA_chatbot_app where you downloaded this repo. Assuming you have already updated required env updates in this project.
5. Build a Contianer image of the application that needs to be deployed to an OpenShift cluster
   `<contianer-engine> build -t qna_streamlit_chat_app:v1.6 .`
6. Create a new namespace for the application 
   `oc new-project <name-qna-namespace>`
7. Tag the container image as shown below - make sure to update the registry url accordingly.
   `<contianer-engine> tag qna_streamlit_chat_app:v1.6 $(oc registry info -n openshift-image-registry)/<name-qna-namespace>/qna_streamlit_chat_app:v1.6`
8. Push the Container image to the OpenShift image registry.
   `<contianer-engine> push $(oc registry info -n openshift-image-registry)/<name-qna-namespace>/qna_streamlit_chat_app:v1.6  --tls-verify=false`
9. Verify if above image is pushed. 
   `oc get is -n <name-qna-namespace>`
10. Deploy the image to OpenShift and expose the Route:
   `oc new-app --image-stream="<name-qna-namespace>/qna_streamlit_chat_app:v1.6" --name=<update-name-of-the-app> -n <name-qna-namespace>`
   `oc expose svc/<update-name-of-the-app> -n <name-qna-namespace>`
11. Retreive the deployed application service details for <update-name-of-the-app> and get the host url
   `oc get routes -n <name-qna-namespace>`

##### Note
- This on prem support deployment is on OCP which is outside the CPD. End user needs to manage their deployments in this case and reachout to RH OCP documenation where ever necessary if you are failing any failures. 
- To support on CPD, we are working on this to enhance this deployment to run inside CPD once solution is supported in future release.

## Troubleshoot 

-  While running step 8 to deploy app with cmd `ibmcloud ce app create --name <name_your_streamlitapp> --build-source .` you may face issues like below.
   - Make sure your check your IAM account if you have enabled Restrict service ID creation if yes then you will see below failure<br> `The permission to create a service ID, which has access to IBM Container Registry, is insufficient` <br>
      - To fix this, you have disable it by running below steps. <br>
        On IBM Cloud Console, go to `Manage > Access (IAM)`, and select `Settings`. <br> In the `Account` section, **Disable** `Restrict service ID creation` and confirm. <br> **Note** Only User with Account owner/admin has required permissions to update this. 
   - Please make sure that you have enough resource/quota limits on container registry or code engine application to run. If not please increase your quota limits or delete unused older applications/images on ibmcloud.
      - check existing applications with `ibmcloud ce app list` identify any unused apps. if have limited quota limit, either delete by running below cmd or increase your quota limits for application
      `ibmcloud ce app delete --name <name_any_outdated_unused_app_to_delete>`
      - check IBM Container Repository images which were previously created. if have limited quota limit, either delete unused images or increase your quota limits for images storage.
      - [Optional] if you havn't installed plugin for IBM Continer Registry. Please run below
         `ibmcloud plugin install container-registry`
      - To delete any outdated previous images. fetch image details using `ibmcloud cr images` and then retrieve corresponding Repository and tag name of the image created for your app.
         `ibmcloud cr image-rm <repository-image-name>:<tag-name>`
   - During This step IBM Code Engine tries build the application based on your local source code. Make sure you don't accidentally create/add any new files/folders under `QnA_chatbot_app` local folder. In case you have added any thing new which is not required for your application. please add them to `.ceignore` file before running the cmd.
