Code Security:

You have implemented and will maintain the technical and personnel focused security policies, procedures, and controls that are necessary to protect the Source Code against loss, alteration, unlawful forms of processing, unauthorized disclosure, and unauthorized access.
You will promptly (and in no event any later than 48 hours) notify IBM after becoming aware of any breach or other security incident that you know, or should reasonably suspect, affects or will affect the Source Code or IBM, and will provide IBM with reasonably requested information about such security incident and the status of any remediation and restoration activities.
