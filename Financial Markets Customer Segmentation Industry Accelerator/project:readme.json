{"markdown":"# Financial Markets Customer Segmentation\n\nThe Financial Markets Customer Segmentation accelerator includes a set of sample data science assets, a structured glossary of business terms, that help you segment customers based on demographics and commonalities in their financial behaviour. The segmentation helps to understand how groups of customers differ from one another.\n\n**Tip:** Download the PDF of these instructions from the Data assets section on the **Assets** page so you can keep these instructions open while you work.\n\n- [Instructions](#instructions)\n- [Sample data assets](#data-assets)\n- [Notebooks](#notebooks)\n- [R Shiny dashboard](#dashboard)\n- [Sample business glossary](#glossary)\n\n<a id=\"instructions\"></a>\n## Instructions\nFollow these steps to implement the industry accelerator:\n\n1 . Create a deployment space, which you'll need when you run the notebooks. From the navigation menu, select **Deployments > View All Spaces > New deployment space** and then complete these steps:\n 1. Enter the name `Customer Segmentation Space`\n 2. Select your Watson Machine Learning service. If you don't have one, click the **Create **button and provision one.\n 3. Click on **Create** to create the deployment space.\n\n2 . Navigate back to the accelerator project, select the **Assets** tab and scroll to the **Notebooks** section.\n\n3 . Edit the **1-data-preprocessing** notebook by clicking the edit icon that looks like a tiny pencil next to the notebook name. This notebook loads the data, creates and saves the `customer_segmentation_prep.py` script to prepare and clean data for model training. It also analyses correlations in the data set. Follow the instructions in the notebook to configure and step through running it.\n\n4 . Edit and run the **2-model-training** notebook. This notebook transforms the data, builds machine learning models, clusters the prepared data into segments and deploys a model.\n\n5 . Edit and run the **3-model-scoring**. This notebook deploys the data assets and model scoring function.\n\n6 . Run the dashboard from RStudio console by completing these steps:\n 1. Download the `customer-segmentation-analytics-dashboard.zip` file from the project's Data assets section of the **Assets** page. If you don't see the file, click **View All** to display the full list of assets.\n 2. Click **Launch IDE > RStudio** on the menu bar.\n 3. In the **Files** pane, select the **Upload** toolbar button and upload the `customer-segmentation-analytics-dashboard.zip` file into RStudio.\n 4. Navigate to `customer-segmentation-analytics-dashboard`, select the `app.R` file, and click the **Run App** toolbar button to launch the dashboard. If you see a warning message that certain packages are not installed, you can ignore it because the packages will be installed first time you run the app.\n 5. Once the app has launched, you can perform clustering and segmentation of clients in real time by entering your API key and selecting your region on the dashboard.\n\n1. Optional.  You can import the glossary of business terms into Watson Knowledge Catalog to get started on data governance. With the **Lite plan** only 5 Business terms can be imported.  You must have <a href=\"https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/catalog/roles-wkcop.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">permission to create governance artifacts</a>.\n    1. Download the `customer-segmentation-glossary-categories.csv`and `customer-segmentation-glossary-terms.csv` files from the Data assets section of the **Assets** page.\n    1. Navigate to **Governance > Categories**.\n    1. Click **Add Category > Import From File**. \n    1. Import the `customer-segmentation-glossary-categories.csv` file. Select **Replace all values** as your merge option.\n    1. Navigate to **Governance > Business Terms**.\n    1. Click **Add Business Term > Import From File**. \n    1. Import the `customer-segmentation-glossary-terms.csv` file. Select **Replace all values** as your merge option.\n    1. Once the Import completes successfully, click on **Go to task** and then click **Publish** in the next page.\n    1. Navigate to **Governance > Categories > Industry Accelerators** to explore the business terms.\n\n\n**Note:** Importing the accelerator and running the notebooks and dashboard consumes approximately 1.5 - 2 Watson Studio CUH and 3 - 3.5 Watson Machine Learning CUH.\n\n <a id=\"data-assets\"></a>\n## Sample data assets\nThese sample data files that act as dimensional and fact tables are included in the project on the **Assets** page:\n\n- `account.csv` : Account type and Account Information Data, Investment Information, Temporal data\n- `customer_summary.csv` : Detailed Customer Transaction Data, Business Metrics, Investment and Income Stats.\n- `customer.csv` : Customer Data, Demographic data.\n- `customer_full_summary_latest.csv`: Joining the above datasets, a csv file is created that is used as raw data input for\nthe data preparation in **1-data-preprocessing** notebook. See `CUSTOMER_FULL_SUMMARY_LATEST.sql` for the SQL query used to merge the tables. The resulting data is filtered, transformed, and aggregated to contain one record per customer, so you can use it for modelling. <br>\n- `cluster_df.csv`: Consolidated prepped data generated in the **2-model-training** notebook after cluster mapping of clients for Exploratory data analysis and Data visualization in the analytics dashboard.\n- `training_data_metadata.json` : Used for standardizing the numeric variables for clustering by scaling the values. \n\n<a id=\"notebooks\"></a>\n## Notebooks\nFollow the instructions in the first few cells of the notebook to configure the project token and API key. Then run the notebooks step-by-step. <br>\n\n- **1-data-preprocessing**: This notebook performs the following functions:\n    - Load data\n    - Create and save script `customer_segmentation_prep.py` to prepare and clean data for model training\n    - Analyze correlations<br>\n- **2-model-training**: This notebook performs the following functions:\n    - Analyze and visualize the data\n    - Principal components analysis\n    - Clustering (K-means) and visualization of clusters\n    - Segment data and saving the ML model \n    - Store the pipeline in the space and deploy the model<br>\n- **3-model-scoring**: This notebook performs the following functions:\n    - Get the deployment space and deployments\n    - Deploy the data assets\n    - Create and deploy a pipeline function for model scoring\n    - Segmenting customers based on the predictions\n\n<a id=\"dashboard\"></a>\n## R Shiny dashboard\nThe R Shiny dashboard displays model insights, customer summaries and scores new data. The dashboard has the following tab:\n\n- `Dashboard View` :  Displays the top action clients, overall customer segments, most frequent features for each segment and graphs describing behavioural market features of each segment. It also provides the option to run Segmentation Scoring, visualizes customers within their corresponding segments, showing their behavioural features based on each selected segment, financial feature ranges, top stats and feature plots. \n\n\n<a id=\"glossary\"></a>\n## Sample business glossary for use with Watson Knowledge Catalog\nOptionally, the glossary of business terms can be imported into Watson Knowledge Catalog to get started on data governance.<br>\nThe `customer-segmentation-glossary-categories.csv` file defines the main and sub categories for the business terms. <br>\nThe `customer-segmentation-glossary-terms.csv` file defines the business terms, category of the business terms and their Related Terms/Part of Terms if applicable. <br>\n**Note:** This optional step requires the [Watson Knowledge Catalog] (https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-knowledge-catalog) service instance. \n\n### Terms and Conditions\nThis project contains Sample Materials, provided under this <a href=\"https://github.com/IBM/Industry-Accelerators/blob/master/CPD%20SaaS/LICENSE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">license</a>. <br/>\nLicensed Materials - Property of IBM. <br/>\nÂ© Copyright IBM Corp. 2019, 2021.
