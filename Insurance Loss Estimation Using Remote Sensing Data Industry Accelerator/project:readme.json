{"markdown":"## Insurance Loss Estimation using Remote Sensing Industry Accelerator\nWith the increase in the number of satellite launches and the dramatic improvements in sensing technology (e.g., better cameras with hyper-spectral imaging, synthetic aperture radar, and lidar), remote sensing data now has much better quality in resolution and spatio-temporal coverage. There is demand for using this data to solve business issues across a wide range of industries, including insurance, urban planning, agriculture, climate change, and flood prevention. This creates a need for ML/AI technology solutions for remote sensing data. <br>\n\nInsurance Loss Estimation Using Remote Sensing Data Industry Accelerator shows how to derive insights from remote sensing data, by utilizing an example of studying flooding events for assisting insurance claims. The idea in this accelerator is to study satellite images before and after a certain event, and with the help of spatiotemporal analysis and ML/AI techniques, we can get insights into which regions are affected and to what extent. Such insights provide valuable information to insurance companies on property damage, allowing claims to be processed more efficiently. <br>\nFor this specific usecase, we picked a category 4 storm event -- Hurricane Laura -- which caused damage to many areas of Louisiana, United States in August, 2020. Insurance companies can use this accelerator to understand remote sensing capabilities to study the flood event, get insights on impacted regions and then predict estimated claims for individal properties.\n\nYour data scientists can use the sample notebooks, remote sensing analysis, predictive model, and dashboard to accelerate data preparation, machine learning modelling, and data reporting.  All the functionality in this accelerator can be generalized and used towards other use cases for remote sensing data.\n\n**Tip:** Download the PDF of these instructions from the Data assets section on the **Assets** page so you can keep these instructions open while you work.\n\n- [Instructions](#instructions)\n- [Sample data assets](#data-assets)\n- [Notebooks](#notebooks)\n- [R Shiny dashboard](#dashboard)\n- [Sample business glossary](#glossary)\n\n<a id=\"instructions\"></a>\n## Instructions\nFollow these steps to implement the industry accelerator:\n1.

You can import the glossary of business terms into Watson Knowledge Catalog to get started on data governance. With the **Lite plan** only 5 Business terms can be imported.  You must have <a href=\"https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/catalog/roles-wkcop.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the permission to create governance artifacts</a>.\n    1. Download the `insurance-loss-estimation-using-remote-sensing-data-glossary-categories.csv` and  `insurance-loss-estimation-using-remote-sensing-data-glossary-terms.csv` files from the Data assets section of the **Assets** page.\n    1. Navigate to **Governance > Categories**.\n    1. Click **Add Category > Import From File**. \n    1. Import the `insurance-loss-estimation-using-remote-sensing-data-glossary-categories.csv` file. Select **Replace all values** as your merge option.\n    1. Navigate to **Governance > Business Terms**.\n    1. Click **Add Business Term > Import From File**. \n    1.
