## Using The Cloud Pak For Data To Reduce Severe Weather Risk

Download the project `reducing-severe-weather-risk-in-insurance-industry-accelerator.tar.gz` from the Releases `CPDv3.5.x` and import it into Cloud Pak for Data v3.5.x. You can also follow the instructions from [Community Page](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/cloudpakfordata/viewdocument/reducing-severe-weather-risk) to download and import the project.

Severe weather has a significant impact on insurers and their policyholders. This industry accelerator
simulates a point in history where there were billions of dollars of damage caused by fire, wind and hail
2‚Äù in size within the south western part of the United States. This accelerator will show how data
engineers, data stewards, data quality analysts, data scientists, citizen data scientists, analysts, and
developers can all focus on their role to reduce severe weather risk and work together at the same time
using Cloud Pak For Data as the ModelOps Platform.


- Collect, ingest and merge historical severe weather (hail, wind, and fire) data, coming The Weather Company Data
    Packages, with historical policyholder claim data to understand what the weather was in the past when a claimed
    occurred. The same data will be used downstream to build test and deploy claim damage prediction models and
    data built by data scientists and analysts.
- Organize your analytic artifacts such as data, notebooks, models, data source connections and
    dashboards making it easy for others to find and collaborate through governed trusted catalogs
- Analyze as a data scientist or analyst, to build, test and deploy a model to predict claim damage or
    develop analytic dashboards to show many views of severe claims damage.
- Infuse model results into downstream dashboards, online/batch scoring and other applications
    such as ESRI maps.
